        "The charts indicate that a customer status of Joined must occur within the first 3 months. In the charts, we can see that no user flagged as Joined has left, however, when we use tenure to indicate new customers, it is observed that plenty of recent (within the last 3 months), customers have indeed left the company. Based on this analysis, all observations should remain in the dataset for the model. In addition, the 'Customer Status' field should be removed for two reasons. First, it overlaps with the target we are looking to predict, which means it cannot be used for the prediciton. Second, the rest of the information contained in this field (essentially an encoded bucket of 'Churn Label' and 'Tenure in Months') is already availible to the model in 'Tenure in Months'."
