# MsDS-customer-churn-prediction
DTSA 5509 Supervised Learning Final Project

I spent 7 years working at Salesforce, one of the largest software as a service (SaaS) companies that sells its cloud software on a subscription based business model. Several of those years were spent in data visualization and business analyst roles working with the renewals organization to build and develop data science models focused on customer health and understand the risk of customers leaving the business.

The main driving focus of these projects was to understand the customer and focus on reducing the chances of customers leaving the subscription based model.  This resulted in a relentless focus on a single KPI, customer attrition (aka customer churn).

In this report, I will play the role of data scientist.  Stepping out of my business-facing role and working with a similar model that was created to predict customer attrition. While I cannot use proprietary business data for this analysis, I will find and use a publicly available customer churn dataset to emulate a similar customer context. I will also use the Random Forest classifier package, similar to the model that was implemented at the company.
